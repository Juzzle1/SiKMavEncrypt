# SiKMavEncrypt
##Simple project to encrypt Mavlink data over SiK using PJRC Teensy between 3DR radio and Mavlink interface
Makes use of the Cape Arduino encryption project (https://github.com/gioblu/Cape)
You need to download this and include with the SiKMavEncrypt in Arduino IDE to compile.


##To do:

 1. Encapsulate encrypted data inside dummy Mavlink frame to allow use of Mavlink optimised setting in SiK radio firmware (currently you must use 'raw data' mode)
 2. Handle non-encrypted RSSI packets generated by SiK radio firmware.

##Hardware required:

 1. 2x 3DR Radio configured in RawData mode (both must be 'Air' type,
    i.e. have serial rather than USB connectors) 
 2. 2x PJRC Teensy 3.2 
 3. 1x USB to TTL serial adapter

##Setup:##

Load SiKMavEncrypt.ino in Arduino IDE
Download and open Cape.h and Cape.cpp from https://github.com/gioblu/Cape
Configure your encryption key and baud rate in SiKMavEncrypt.ino and upload the same settings to both Teensy boards.
